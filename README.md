step to carry out:
1. you can execute the code either each algorithms independently for visualising 
 [OR]
2.you can visualise using a common menu for choosing the algorithms "main.py"
3.open the py file main.py using python interpretor
4.display UI in cmd shell would pop up and you can check out the cool visualisation
